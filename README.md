# DungeonOfDoom
This was our rogue-like game that my team (6 students) developed as part of the coursework for the Software Engineering module at the University of Bath. Myself and one other team member did most of the development work for this project. We also created substantial documentation for the game and produced over 100 pages detailing the process and product. The overall aim of this module was to learn about Agile practices and how to implement these in a software engineering environement. Our game won the 'Most Fun to Play' award and we all received first-class marks for the overall project.

## Instructions
Enter your name in the start window and click 'Start'. The arrow keys are used to move the character around the dungeon and the aim is to collect all of the gold and only one type of potion. Once all the gold is collected, a vortex will appear which leads you out of the dungeon and the game is completed. Press the 'M' key to mute the music.

## Developer comments
We used the Java Swing framework, although this was the first time using this framework for both of us. We also attempted unit testing using JUnit 5, but again we both had almost no experience doing this and so did not manage to get any proper tests working.
